## Duet AI Assistant to simplify development

Use Duet AI, your AI-powered collaborator, to accomplish
tasks more effectively and efficiently. Duet AI provides contextualized
responses to your prompts to help guide you on what you're trying to do with
your code. It also shares source citations regarding which documentation and
code samples the assistant used to generate its responses. You can do this right
in the IDE to avoid having to context-switch out to your browser or
documentation. [Read the docs](https://cloud.google.com/duet-ai/docs/overview)

## Google Cloud APIs at your fingertips

Browse available Cloud APIs, enable services, and install and learn how to
integrate client libraries in your app without leaving your IDE and breaking
your development flow, all with the API library browser.
[Read the docs](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode/client-libraries)

## Develop Cloud Functions locally

View, download, deploy, and test Cloud Functions directly from Cloud Code.
Leverage the power of the VS Code IDE to make changes to your Cloud Function,
then deploy those changes without ever needing to leave Cloud Code.
[Read the docs](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode/create-deploy-function)

## Kubernetes development

Create and run a new app in minutes with Cloud Code’s Kubernetes support. Or
work on an existing application, customize its YAML with Cloud Code’s
intelligent authoring support, debug it relentlessly with the setup-free
debugger, and run it on any of your Kubernetes clusters. Whatever your workflow
is, Cloud Code helps you spend less time on configuration and context-switching,
so you can focus on developing your app.
[Read the docs](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode/k8s-overview)

## Cloud Run development

Create and deploy a new service in minutes with Cloud Code's Cloud Run support,
monitoring your service's progress with the Cloud Run Explorer and service logs
accessible in the Log Viewer. If you'd prefer a local development workflow, you
can also develop and debug a service locally with the built-in Cloud Run
emulator.

## Containerization made easy

Create secure, production-ready container images from source code without having
to worry about a Dockerfile with Cloud Code's built-in support for Google Cloud
Buildpacks. You get to focus on building your application, not containerizing
it.

## Built-in Secret Manager support

Protect sensitive information and keep your app secure with Cloud Code's
integrated Secret Manager support. You can create, view, update, and use secrets
in the Secret Manager view without having them in your codebase.
[Read the docs](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode/secret-manager)

Browse Compute Engine Virtual Machines and their relevant properties without
leaving your IDE. Easily SSH into your VM using the terminal window and transfer
files from your local environment to your virtual machine all with Cloud Code
support for Compute Engine.
[Read the docs](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode/manage-vms)
