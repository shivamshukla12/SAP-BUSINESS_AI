          Google Cloud Code Plugin Software License Agreement

This Cloud Code Plugin Software License Agreement (“Agreement”) for use of the
Software (as defined below) is entered into between Google LLC (“Google”) and
you, on behalf of yourself and the organization you represent, if any
(“Licensee”).  If you are accepting on behalf of an organization, do not
install or access this Software unless you are authorized to represent that
organization.

1. Term and Termination. This Agreement is effective on the date Licensee first
   installs or accesses the Software and will continue until (a) Google
   terminates this Agreement by sending written notice of termination to the
   other party (including via email) or (b) Customer terminates the Agreement
   by ceasing to use the Software and complying with the obligations stated in
   Section 7 (Effects of Termination).

2. The Software.

   a. Generally. Under this Agreement, Licensee may use Google’s Cloud Code
      software offering(s) made available with or through this Agreement and
      any associated documentation (collectively referred to in this Agreement
      as the “Software”) and for the limited uses described in this Agreement.

   b. Software License. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Google grants
      to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, limited
      license to copy and use the Software during the term of this Agreement,
      including (i) for Licensee’s internal business purposes and (ii) to
      develop materials, so long as Licensee does not modify or distribute any
      component of the Software or include any component of the Software in the
      materials Licensee develops. Any materials Licensee develops using the
      Software may not violate (A) applicable laws, (B) Google's or any third
      party’s rights, or (C) any Google policies Google notifies Licensee of.
      Licensee retains title, ownership and all rights to any materials
      Licensee develops.

   c. Use Restrictions.  Licensee will not, and will not allow End Users or
      third parties under its control to: (i) copy (except as expressly
      described in this Agreement), modify, create a derivative work of,
      reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt
      to extract any of the source code of the Software (except to the extent
      such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law); (ii)
      sublicense, transfer, or distribute any of the Software; (iii) sell,
      resell, or otherwise make the Software available to a third party as
      part of a commercial offering; or (iv) use the Software: (A) for High
      Risk Activities; or (B) in a manner that breaches, or facilitates the
      breach of, Export Control Laws.

   d. Third Party and Open Source Components. Third party components (which
      may include open source software) and other open source components of
      the Software may be subject to separate license agreements. To the
      limited extent a third party license or open source license expressly
      applies to a component of the Software, that license supersedes this
      Agreement and governs Licensee’s use of that component. In addition,
      Licensee may be required to procure and utilize certain third party
      software to utilize the Software.

   e. Export Control Classification. The Software is classified in the U.S.
      under ECCN 5D002 and generally eligible for license exception ENC in Part
      740.17(b)(1), subject to the requirements of that exception.

   f. Information Sent from the Software. The Software may send certain
      analytics data (for example, features used, actions taken, and
      technical information about the End User's device), subject to available
      Licensee controls included in the Software.  Google’s collection and use
      of such data is governed by Google’s Privacy Policy, available at
      https://policies.google.com/privacy.

3. Ownership; Feedback. Google and its suppliers and licensors will own all
   right, title and interest to the Software.  All rights not expressly granted
   in this Agreement are reserved by Google.  Google may request that Licensee,
   at its option, provides Google with suggestions and feedback (“Feedback”),
   which may include, without limitation, bug reports, documentation feedback,
   and verbal product feedback, or responses to short written questionnaires
   provided by Google from time to time.  If Licensee provides Feedback related
   to the Software, then Google may use that information without obligation to
   Licensee, and Licensee assigns to Google all right, title, and interest in
   that Feedback. Where due to mandatory statutory law, such assignment is not
   permitted, Customer herewith agreed to grant to Google a worldwide,
   perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate the
   Feedback into the Software. Customer waives the right to be named as author.
   Google agrees that no Feedback used by Google will be directly attributed to
   Licensee.

4. No Support. Google is not obligated under this Agreement to provide any
   technical support for the Software (including any standard Google Cloud
   Platform technical support services).

5. Indemnification. Licensee agrees to hold harmless and indemnify Google, its
   employees, agents, and representatives, from and against any third party
   claim related to Licensee’s use of the Software or other activities under
   this Agreement.

  a. The Software is provided “as is” and to the fullest extent permitted by
     applicable law, Google does not make any warranties of any kind with

     error-free or uninterrupted use of any component of the Software;

     https://cloud.google.com/terms/) and the Data Processing and Security
     Terms (available at https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms)
     do not apply to any component of the Software; and

  d. Licensee is responsible for protecting Licensee, Licensee’s property and
     data, and others from any risks caused by the Software.

   cease all use of the Software and delete all Software from its systems.

8. Binding Arbitration.

      Association’s International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance
      with its Expedited Commercial Rules in force as of the date of this
      Agreement ("Rules").

  (c) The parties will mutually select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be
      conducted in English in Santa Clara County, California, USA.

  (d) Either party may apply to any competent court for injunctive relief
      necessary to protect its rights pending resolution of the arbitration.
      The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with
      the remedies and limitations in this Agreement.

  (e) Subject to the confidentiality requirements in subsection (g), either
      party may petition any competent court to issue any order necessary to
      protect that party's rights or property; this petition will not be
      considered a violation or waiver of this governing law and arbitration
      section and will not affect the arbitrator’s powers, including the power
      to review the judicial decision. The parties stipulate that the courts
      of Santa Clara County, California, USA, are competent to grant any order
      under this Subsection (e).

  (f) The arbitral award will be final and binding on the parties and its
      execution may be presented in any competent court, including any court
      with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property.

  (g) Any arbitration proceeding conducted in accordance with this Section
      will be considered confidential information, including (i) the existence
      of, (ii) any information disclosed during, and (iii) any oral
      communications or documents related to the arbitration proceedings,

      the information described in this Subsection (g) to a competent court as
      may be necessary to file any order under Subsection (e) or execute any
      arbitral decision, but the parties must request that those judicial
      proceedings be conducted in camera (in private).

  (h) The parties will pay the arbitrator’s fees, the arbitrator's appointed
      experts' fees and expenses, and the arbitration center's administrative
      expenses in accordance with the Rules. In its final decision, the
      arbitrator will determine the non-prevailing party's obligation to
      reimburse the amount paid in advance by the prevailing party for these
      fees.

  (i) Each party will bear its own lawyers’ and experts’ fees and expenses,
      regardless of the arbitrator’s final decision regarding the Dispute.

   each party retains all rights it would have independent of this Agreement.
   All legal notices must be in English, in writing (including email), and
   addressed to the other party’s primary contact, which for Google is
   legal-notices@google.com. Neither party may assign this Agreement without
   the prior written consent of the other party. Any amendment must be in
   writing and signed by both parties. This Agreement states all terms agreed
   between the parties and cancels and replaces all other agreements between
   the parties relating to its subject matter. Any use of “including” in this
